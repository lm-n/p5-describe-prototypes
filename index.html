  	<h1>describe() & describeElement()</h1>
  		<p>This set of functions aims to provide p5.js users with simple and easy ways to create text-based canvas descriptions that are accessible to screen readers and that can also be displayed under the canvas as a canvas label. Although p5.js sketches go beyond the canvas, the most significant barrier for access is in the nature of this html element — which is just a bitmap with no information about any drawn objects. With these functions, instead of creating a “shadow DOM” as with the accessibility add-on, the goal is to provide descriptions for screen readers through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Hit_regions_and_accessibility">fallback content</a> in the sub DOM of the canvas element. Users can also easily display the descriptions outside of the fallback content to use them as canvas labels akin to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_label" target="_blank">tombstone or exhibit labels/captions<a>.</p>
